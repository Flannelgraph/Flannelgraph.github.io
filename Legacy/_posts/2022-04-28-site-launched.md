Welcome to the first official post on Flannelgraph's official website!

Howdy, this is Ben Schmidt speaking to you, please keep your hands and arms inside the ride at all times for the safety of you and those around you. Thank you!

Wondering what am I doing here? I plan on using this website to inform people about games we're working on, what progress we're making, and also host general information about Flannelgraph. You know, usual website stuff. I may occasionally post news related topics in here, but I will attempt to post interesting tidbits of technical knowledge on a weekly basis.

For this first post I wasn't going to bore anyone with web development stuff, mostly because there is actaully no JavaScript for this website and I don't want to burden anyone else with the cursed knowledge of CSS and html label shenanigans (the hamburger menu runs off of two html checkboxes, because why not). If you are interested in the inner workings, feel free to take a look at the Git repository hosting the website files <a href="https://github.com/Flannelgraph/Flannelgraph.github.io">here</a>.

Anyways, I hope you stick around and follow Flannelgraph on our journey wherever God leads us. Feel free to <a href="/about">read our about page</a> or look at some of the <a href="/games">games I made with friends for game jams</a> during your stay.

Until next time,
Ben Schmidt
