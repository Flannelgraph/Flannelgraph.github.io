      <h2>Fighting Game - In Development</h2>
      <p>We're currently working with Weird Disciple Publishing to make a new fighting game. We are already working towards an MVP and have a group of people helping us with music and voice acting. Look forward to seeing more information as we continue to work on this project!</p>
      <h2>Game Jam Games</h2>
	<p>These games were made during game jams, either exclusively by Flannelgraph team members or collaborating with others.</p>
