title: About Flannelgraph

<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hello there!</h1> <! ;) >
	<p>Flannelgraph was originally conceived of by Benjamin Schmidt while he was attending Virginia Tech. Interested in game design and armed in a growing knowledge in computer science, he joined a game developement club. There he started learning the basics and competing in some smaller game jams. He enjoyed making games enough that he decided to continue pursuing the art of making games.</p>
	<p>While trying to figure out how to move forward in his ambitions, Benjamin Schmidt started sharing game ideas with his friend Virgil Thornton II. They realized there was a sore lack of decent games with Christian ideals. They agreed to work together to bring new, exciting, and engaging games that everyone would enjoy playing.</p>
	<p>Once graduated, Flannelgraph was created by Benjamin Schmidt as a platform to help him and his friend Virgil Thornton II at <a href="https://weirddisciple.com/">Weird Disciple Publishing</a> to start designing and developing games.</p>
	<p>Feel free to check out our <a href="/blog/">Blog</a> here at Flannelgraph, and I hope you find something that peaks your interest during your stay.</p>
